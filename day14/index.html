    let age2 = age

    age = 200
    console.log(age, age2)

    // Let's say we have an array
    const players = ['Wes', 'Sarah', 'Ryan', 'Poppy'];
    // and we want to make a copy of it.
    const team = players //reference
    console.log(team, players)
    //team[3] = "Lux"
    // You might think we can just do something like this:

    // however what happens when we update that array?

    // now here is the problem!

    // oh no - we have edited the original array too!

    // Why? It's because that is an array reference, not an array copy. They both point to the same array!

    // So, how do we fix this? We take a copy instead!
    const team2 = players.slice() //returning new array
    const team3 = [].concat(players) //new array
    const team4 = [...players] //spread it
    const team5 = Array.from(players)
    //original array is untouched
    // one way

    // or create a new array and concat the old one in

    // or use the new ES6 Spread

    // now when we update it, the original one isn't changed

    // The same thing goes for objects, let's say we have a person object

    // with Objects
    const person = {
      name: 'Wes Bos',
      age: 80
    };

    // and think we make a copy:
    const captain = person //this is a reference
    //captain.number = 99

    console.log(person)

    // how do we take a copy instead?

    const cap2 = Object.assign({}, person, {number: 99})
    console.log(cap2)

    // We will hopefully soon see the object ...spread

    const cap3 = {
      ...person,
      captain: "yes"
    }

    console.log(cap3)

    // Things to note - this is only 1 level deep - both for Arrays and Objects. lodash has a cloneDeep method, but you should think twice before using it.

    const wes = {
      name: "Wes",
      age: 100,
      social: {
        twitter: "@wesbos",
        facebook: 'wesbos.developer'
      }
    }
    console.clear()
    console.log(wes)
    //only one level deep
    const dev = Object.assign({}, wes)

    console.log(dev)

    //tricky deep level - JSON.stringify -> returns a string -> JSON.parse -> returns a new object from that string -> lost the reference
    const dev2 = JSON.parse(JSON.stringify(wes))
